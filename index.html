        <p>This application's front end was created using HTML5 and CSS. Behind the scenes, we utilize Python's easy to learn and very usefull language to talk directly with databases.</p>
        <p>You can create simple queries using our plug-in-data feature and create complex ones as well.</p>
        <p>You can also convert queries from one database language to another. Say you want to know what the CRUD operation looks like compared to another       database's CRUD.</p>
        <p>We have lots of stretch goals we would like to acomplish but for now, we are still trying to make this application usable, at the basics.</p>
